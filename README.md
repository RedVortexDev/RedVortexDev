# RedVortex
Hello!! I'm a Java & Web developer, alongside some others, I love learning and working on projects.

# Languages
* Astro, Vite, Svelte
* CSS, TailwindCSS, SCSS
* Java (my default language and the one I like the most)
* JS (Node, Express), Python
* SQL, MongoDB, Git

## Learning
* C# (should be similar enough to Java, but I haven't found the right time)
* TypeScript (it has some quirks and features I haven't got around learning)

## Contact
Talk to me on Discord about anything for any reason you might have! **`@bukkit.yml`**

Oh, and check out my [DiamondFire-related website](https://red.dfonline.dev/) coded in Svelte and TypeScript!
